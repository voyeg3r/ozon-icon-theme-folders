# Ozon
These are additional Folder Icons for the default icon theme for OzonOS. It's licensed under the GNU GPLv3+.

## Installing
[Download the Source](https://github.com/ozonos/ozon-icon-theme-folders/archive/master.zip), extract it, and copy one of the "Ozon-Colored" folders with your desired color (or all of them) to one of the following icon theme locations:

* **Global** (all users)
  * `/usr/share/icons/`
* **Local** (current user)
  * `~/.icons`
  * `~/.local/share/icons/`

**You can also run the following commands in your terminal:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ozonos/ozon-icon-theme-folders.git
cd ozon-icon-theme-folders
make install
```

## Icon Requests
The Ozon developers will only be covering the programs that come by default with the OS. We will however be welcoming user contributions to fill in the gaps - see below for more info. Regardless, you're more than welcome to submit requests for all missing applications. For normal applications follow [this video tutorial](https://plus.google.com/+NumixprojectOrg/posts/DkRmhFZuWez), for Steam games follow [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuUy4CzCoXc) and for Chrome apps just post a link to the webstore page (in each case, substitute "Ozon" for "Numix"). When filing your request please be respectful, patient.

## User Contributions
We welcome user contributions for all icons as long as they follow our [style guidelines](https://github.com/ozonos/ozon-icon-theme/wiki/Guidelines). If you're unsure how to work with GitHub, see [this tutorial](https://github.com/ozonos/ozon-icon-theme/wiki/Contributing). We've compiled a list of icons that need to be covered first, so if you want to contribute an icon, but don't know where to start see [this list](https://github.com/ozonos/ozon-icon-theme/labels/community).
